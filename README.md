# ML-Facemask-detection
ML program for face mask detection using python libraries - sklearn, matplotlib

I have used voila jones algorithm - haar feature algorithm- CV.2 - numpy

created data with_mask and without_mask

used sklearn Svm and model_selection for training and testing data

Using data collection save the data as without_mask then run the capture program again and save as with_mask
